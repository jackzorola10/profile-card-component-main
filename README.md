## Overview
### The challenge

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This is the first one of the challenges I did with a relatively high Lighthouse Report Score. Some of the points mentioned to fix was the fact that the _"Document doesn't use legible font sizes"_ but these were as specified in the Figma design. 

I think it makes a good point about the communication between development and design, to let them know about these specific type of issues.
